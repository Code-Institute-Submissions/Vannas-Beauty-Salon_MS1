# Surface

## Design 
 As the salon itself exudes calm and relaxation, I created the page in such a tone. The background colors I used are bright and soothing, and the images are bright and colorful. The goal was to bring the user closer to the atmosphere of the salon.

 ### Chosen colors:
- #3a3a3a the main color
- #2a2a2a for all h2 headings and nav bar
- rgba(237, 243, 210, 0.6) - for the "Contact" section 
- rgb(157 157 45 / 43%) - for the "Contact" section for max-width 550px
- rgba(79, 79, 82, 0.6) - for the Footer background
- rgba(154, 175, 185, 0.7) - for the "Price List" background color
- rgba(79, 79, 82) - for the Submit button


### Font 
- Open Sans, sans-serif - main font
- Lato - for all h2 and h3 headings


### Media 
- Hero image - is designed in bright and strong colors to grab the user's attention and elevate the overall look of the page

 - Contact section - contains a background image that is soothing and mild. Not conspicuous, and yet does not make the page monotonous

 - Services & Prices - contains a background imag that is mild and blends nicely with the background color of services and prices

 - Our Team - contains an image just below the navigation . The photo shows a beautician doing a manicure to a customer. I chose this image because it shows a beautician in her work environment and blends nicely with the whole look of the page.

- Gallery - contains nail design images so that the user can find the desired design, if he needs inspiration. The gallery also helps promote the salon

- Contact Us - contains images just below the navigation. Images are placed horizontally. After 950 px they no longer appear on the page.
