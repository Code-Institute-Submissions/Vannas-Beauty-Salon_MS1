# Vanna's Beuty Salon
This project is a small website for my sister's beauty salon.
I designed the site with the aim of bringing the users  closer to a good, professional and affordable service.

## UX

The site is presented in a minimalist bus effective way, providing all the information the user needs. In general, users can find out more about Vanna's Beuty Salon, his team, services and how to contact them. Main focus of this project is on bringing good and qulity service to potential clients. With this in mind, I create a one page scroll with four sections.
